    /*  classifyPillOwnership
     *
     *  What does this do? Returns classification of which person/pill the data actually belonged to.
     *
     *  class = 1 ===> my pill
     *  class = -1 ==> other pill
     *
     *  -There are two sources and two measurements, as time series (person1, pill1_vecs(t), person2, pill2_vecs(t) )
     *  -person 1 moves and it shows up on pill1, and to a lesser extent pill2
     *  -person 2 moves and it shows up on pill2, and to a lesser extend pill1.
     *  -I can go and compute the covariance between pill1 and pill2 data.  What does this tell us?
     *
     *   It tells us how correlated pill1 and pill2 are, and on what feature (magnitude, duration, kickoff counts, etc.).
     *
     *   Great, now what?
     *
     *   If I do an Eigen value decomposition on this covariance matrix, I will find find the independent combination of features
     *   that is present in the data, ranked by how much variance/"energy" of the data is in that dimension.  And, I would hope that this
     *   corresponds to something meaningful.
     *
     *   Fooling around with this, we consistently see that the first most energy combination (the Eigen vector) is
     *   a1 * x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3.... where ai > 0.3
     *   this is basically saying "yeah, the most energy is in the data amplitude"  Well that's comforting
     *
     *   Almost always the next most energetic Eigen vector is
     *   a1*x2 + a2*x2 + a3*x3...  a1,a2,a3 > 0.3, and a3,a4,a5 < -0.3
     *
     *   This is saying that the difference between pill1 feats and pill2 feats is an important feature.  And, it gave us the optimal
     *   weights to calculate this feature.
     *
     *   So, we check to make sure the second eigenvectors what we expect.  If it's not, we just return the original data.
     *   Then, we transform the data into the direction of this eigenvector, and say if it's really greater than zero, it came from pill1
     *   and if it's really less than 0 it came from pill2.
     *
     *   In our case, if it came from pill2, we remove the data point.
