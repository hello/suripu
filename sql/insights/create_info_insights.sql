'Effects of light in the environment on your sleep',
'Light influences our internal clock through specialized "light sensitive" cells in the retina of our eyes, which sends messages to the brain that keep us in a 24-hour cycle or the **circadian rhythm**. These are physical, mental and behavioral changes that follow a roughly a 24-hour cycle, responding primarily to light and darkness in our environment.

The increase and decrease of light cues, trigger different chemical reactions our body, causing changes to our physiology and behavior. As evening approaches and the light in our environment recedes, the hormone melatonin begins to rise, the body temperature falls, thus making us less alert and more likely to fall sleep. In the morning light, melatonin levels are low, the body temperature begins to rise, and other chemical shifts, such as a rise in the activating hormone cortisol, then will help us to feel alert and ready for the day.'

----
('temperature', '', 'Effects of Temperature on Your Sleep',
'The temperature of your sleeping environment and how comfortable you feel in it effects the quality of sleep because our brain has an ideal **set point** for body temperature that it is trying to achieve, almost like an internal thermostat. If it’s too cold, or too hot, the body struggles to achieve this set point, hence interrupting sleep. The usual recommendation is to keep the bedroom cool, quiet, & dark, between 65°F (18°C) and 72°F (22°C). However, the perfect room temperature level is different for everyone and should be whatever is most comfortable for the sleeper.'
),
----
('sound', '', 'Sound: ambient sound or sudden loud noises',
'Even while you''re asleep, your brain continues to register and process sounds. A loud noise can interrupt sleep causing you to wake up, shift between stages of sleep, or experience a rise or fall in heart rate and blood pressure. Whether sounds disturb your sleep or not depends on factors such as the stage of sleep you''re in, the time of night, and even your own personal feelings about the sounds themselves. Researchers have seen that we are more likely to wake up when a sound is relevant or emotionally charged and has personal significance. If you have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, creating a constant ambient sound could help mask activity from inside and outside your environment allowing a more peaceful slumber.'
),
----
('humidity', '', 'Effects of Humidity on Your Sleep',
'Humid heat exposure during night sleep is an important factors effecting sleep because heat stress increases the thermal load during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which increases wakefulness. Humid heat exposure increases heat stress because of the difference in the sweat response caused by the humidity. Decreased ambient humidity allows sweat to evaporate, thereby dissipating the heat, whereas increased humidity does not allow the sweat to evaporate, causing the skin to remain wet, causing you to wake up more readily.'
),
----
('air_quality', '', 'Effects of Air Quality',
'Poor air quality causes interruptions in the quality of your sleep, whereas good air quality can improve your sleep. Breathing in contaminants or air pollutants while you are sleeping results in restlessness and a lack of sufficient oxygen into the bloodstream, causing restlessness, excessive daytime sleepiness, lethargy, and confusion.

 The deep breathing that occurs during sleep causes the body to inhale many irritating particles that agitate the respiratory system and cause coughing, sneezing, inflammation of the sinuses, and other sleep disturbing effects. Those with allergies, asthma, or other breathing difficulties find it most bothersome because poor air quality can aggravate the symptoms of these conditions and make sleeping nearly impossible.

 Breathing poor quality air while sleeping can result in clogged sinuses, a stuffy nose, headache, or scratchy throat due to the contaminants breathed in during the night.

('sleep_duration', '', 'Sleep Duration: What''s the ideal amount?',
'Most healthy adults, including the elderly need **between 7.5 to 9 hours** of sleep per night to function at their best.  Children need even more (the younger they are, the more they need); for example, current guidelines say school-age children should sleep at least 10 hours per night.  However, there is no "magic number" on the sleep duration that is ideal for everyone.  It is as individual as you are.  Not only do different age groups need different amounts of sleep, but it is unique to the individual.'

----
('time_to_sleep', '', 'Sleep Onset',
'*Sleep onset* is the transition from wakefulness into sleep. *Sleep onset insomnia* is trouble falling asleep. *Sleep maintenance insomnia* is trouble staying asleep.

 Sleep onset is different for everyone but if it takes too long or happens immediately then it can be unhealthy and an indication of a sleep disorder like narcolepsy or insomnia. The transition from wakefulness to sleep and vise versa should happen peacefully and gradually as opposed to abruptly. Once you wake up, you should arise immediately as opposed to "snoozing" as this is the best scenario for starting your day. It is important that when your alarm goes off at your selected wake time, you get right up.

 Specialists recommend keeping a sleep log in order to track your success. Sense keeps a record your bedtime and wake time, and notifies you of any changes in your sleep patterns.'

('sleep_time', '', 'Sleep & Wake Time',
'Both your sleep time and wake time should be **relatively consistent** because the body''s clock gets used to a certain pattern. This helps to keep the body in sync and to ensure the optimal and most restful sleep. You should select a wake time that you can observe every day, including weekends depending on your individual needs and schedule.

 Our bodies follow a circadian rhythm that relies on consistency. There are many things that you do at about the same time every day, sleep should follow suit. Anchoring your wake time in place is a cue to your body about when you should be awake and when you should be asleep. Waking at the same time every day will actually helps you to sleep better at night. This is especially important for people who have difficulties falling or staying asleep, a characteristic of insomnia.

'Studies indicate people sleep significantly better and feel more alert during the day if they get **at least 150 minutes** (the national guideline) of **moderate to vigorous** of exercise a week.

 Upwards of a 65% improvement in sleep quality is realized through regular exercise. In addition regular exercise relaxes you, lengthens and deepens sleep and you will feel less sleepy during the day, compared to those with less physical activity. Exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may also promote falling asleep.

 Exercise also significantly improves the sleep of people with chronic insomnia by its effects on circadian rhythms, by decreasing arousals, anxiety and depressive symptoms.'

----
('caffeine', '', 'Caffeine',
'Sleep is very **much affected by caffeine** intake and there is an association between the daily intake of caffeine, sleep problems and daytime sleepiness. Even a moderate dose of caffeine at bedtime; up to 6 hours prior to bedtime, has a significant effect on sleep disturbance. The most marked effects of caffeine on sleep is prolonged sleep latency, shorter total sleep time, increase in light sleep and shortening of deep sleep time, as well as more frequent awakenings. Specialists recommend *refraining from substantial caffeine* use for a minimum of *6 hours prior to bedtime*.'
),
----
('alcohol', '', 'Alcohol',
'One of the most common misconceptions is that alcohol consumption is a good sleep aid, as it does help induce sleep. However overall, it is **more disruptive to sleep**, causing arousals particularly in the second half of the night. In addition it reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the deepest and most restorative stage of sleep.  Alcohol is a poor choice as a hypnotic because it may lead to alcohol dependence and alcoholism, and may intensify sleep-related breathing disturbances like sleep apnea. Alcohol does not improve sleep quality and actually is a detriment to the quality of sleep.'
),
----
('diet', '', 'Diet',
'Diet has one of the most **significant effects on sleep**, from what you consume before bed (and at what time) to the direct link between sleep apnea (sleep disordered breathing) and obesity. Sleep is in fact inherently linked with how we eat (and how much). Food is also related to sleep by appetite and metabolism. People who don''t get enough sleep are more likely to have bigger appetites due to the fact that their leptin levels (an appetite regulating hormone) fall, promoting appetite increase. Researchers showed that not getting enough sleep actually affects how hard it is to resist unhealthy foods.

 This link between appetite and sleep provides further evidence that sleep and obesity are linked. To top it off, the psychological manifestations of fatigue, sleep and hunger are similar. There is also an association between the number of calories consumed and sleep duration. Those who consumed the most were more likely to have the shortest sleep duration.'
),
----
('daytime_sleepiness', '', 'Daytime Sleepiness',
'*Excessive Daytime sleepiness* (EDS) or feeling tired during the day is characterized by persistent sleepiness, headaches and lack of energy, even after a seemingly prolonged nighttime sleep.

 EDS is related to insufficient sleep time, disrupted sleep, or a shift or disruption in circadian timing, or hypersomnia and an increased need for sleep during a 24-hour period. EDS is a condition encompassing several sleep disorders where increased sleep is a symptom, of another underlying disorder like narcolepsy, sleep apnea or a circadian rhythm disorder, it is a neurological disorder in which there is a sudden recurrent uncontrollable compulsion to sleep. EDS  is also known as narcolepsy. Among adults in the US, about 35 to 40% of the population have excessive daytime sleepiness or have problems with falling asleep or with daytime sleepiness.

 EDS may affect daytime function associated difficulties in attention, reaction time, memory function, and other behavioral impacts. The most common complaints of EDS include forgetfulness, fatigue, mood changes, inattentiveness, or lapses of attention. In general, EDS can be attributed to a variety of behavioral and lifestyle issues.'
),
----
('daytime_activities', '', 'Daytime Activities',
'A growing body of scientific research indicates that **stressful daytime activities** can have profound effects on sleep, including sleep disruptions and insomnia. Seven out of ten adults in the US report experiencing stress or anxiety daily basis, and most say it interferes at least moderately with their lives and gives them trouble sleeping. The majority of adults with a stress-induced sleep problems experience it at least once per week, and more than half experience it at least several times a week.

 Research indicates links between sleep and stress (especially work stress) that highlights the potential for a vicious cycle. Even if you don''t have a lot of events in your life that others would consider stressful, the degree to which you believe that events are stressful leads to insomnia.

 However, it is not only those exposed to extreme amounts of stress (like our military personnel for example), who experience difficulties sleeping. Also anxiety produced from a common act of emotional labor (i.e., faking a smile while at work) is sufficient enough to lead to insomnia.'
),
----
('sleep_quality', '', 'Amount of Movement during Sleep',
'Tossing and turning generally occurs during brief interruptions of sleep during the night. Chemical systems in your brain work to paralyze skeletal muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, keeping you still at night. But simple factors such as high temperature or light levels can lead to restless sleep. Excessive alcohol, heavy meals, and caffeine before bed can also cause tossing and turning in bed. Lastly, serious conditions such as acid reflux, periodic limb movement, and sleep apnea can contribute to high levels of movement during the night.'

Light, whether it be artificial or natural, is the primary signal for your circadian rhythm. This governs not only your sleep, but also your mood, appetite, and more. In the morning, light prompts your body to wake up while blood flow and alertness increases. In the evening, the dimming of light tells your body to cool down, relax, and rest.

Too little light early in the day confuses your internal clock, which can feel like a miniature dose of jet lag. Similarly, too much exposure to bright or blue light in the evening can artificially pump you up when you’re trying to unwind.

'Sleep deprivation leads to an increase in ghrelin, the hormone that makes you feel hunger. At the same time, it causes a decrease in leptin, the hormone that lets you know to stop eating. As a result of this imbalance, you''ll stay hungry even as you keep eating, past the point where you''d otherwise feel satisfied. Good sleep keeps these hormones properly balanced, helping you keep your hunger in check.');

'Your brain is creating memories every moment that you''re awake, but they''re raw and fragile. While you''re in deep sleep, these memories are inventoried and catalogued. Some less-important memories are discarded while others are retained - and in some cases, even strengthened.

While you''re in REM sleep, your brain then works to connect related memories together, sometimes with unexpected results. If you''ve ever woken up and suddenly had new insight into a problem or question that''s been bothering you, this might be why.

A lack of sleep not only prevents your brain from performing these necessary tasks, but it can also disrupt your ability to form new memories in the first place.');

Simply put, good sleep makes it easier to resolve conflicts, which helps you build and maintain strong relationships.');

Monday Night Football games begin at 8:30 eastern time, no matter where the game happens. This means that for West Coast players, it''s a full three hours earlier, and their bodies are gearing up for another burst of energy.

When you''re sleep deprived, your body''s ability to store this energy is lessened, and your athletic performance can take a significant hit. Even if you load up on extra carbohydrates, you’ll find that you run through your available glycogen much faster than you would on a good night''s sleep.');

'It can be easy to spend all day at your desk; according to one government estimate, the average American spends 90% of their life indoors. But being outdoors can be great for your health. So this week, make a habit out of spending a little bit of time outside every day. Even just 15 minutes will do the trick.

Sunshine kick-starts the production of vitamin D, whose amazing mood-elevating and disease-fighting powers have been observed in many population-based studies. Vitamin D is helpful against everything from osteoporosis to mood disorders. The sweet spot in getting enough light for vitamin D production seems to be around 10 to 15 minutes a day for most people; after that, make sure to put on sunscreen.

Additionally, light is an essential signal that regulates your sleep-wake cycle. Getting light when the sun is out lets your body know when it should be awake and alert, and conversely, when it should be relaxed and ready for sleep. Think about taking a walk outside during the day as an investment for getting good sleep later that night.');

Beyond the effect of blue light, spending time with your phone or other device at night can impact your sleep in other ways, too. Technology is a psychological stimulant for many people, and can excite you during the time when you should be winding down. Using these devices at bedtime can create a psychological association between your bedroom and being alert, which is the opposite of what you want for sleep.

First, you may want to think twice before taking a midday nap. While this can be tempting, sleeping during the day can throw off your natural sleep cycle and make it much harder to fall asleep at night.

Vigorous exercise too close to bedtime can also make falling asleep difficult. Regular exercise has been shown to promote good sleep, but if the only time you have to work out is right before bed, you may want to consider a more gentle exercise like yoga.
